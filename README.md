# Agile archer

Agile archer is a 2d game at side scroller perspective. The game will feature turn based mechanics, with moves taking up a finite amount of energy. So you can do as much in a turn as you want.
The idea will be to allow variety in approach, while still having a fair pace. The groups of enemies will be in stages, with different set layouts, and will come from all sorts of angles.

- Single frame, arena style to start with. Move towards standard platform/sidescroller camera after.
- Designed levels, potentially some randomness here too
- Possibly perma death. It depends on if I want to have a beginning, middle and end.
- Ray tracing path finding
- Combat will be unit selective. Using abilities and such to be more efficient.
